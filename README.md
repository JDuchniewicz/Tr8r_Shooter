Wild-West-Massacre
==============
Slavic Game Jam 2017 local multiplayer Top down shooter where players don't know with whom they play

The theme of the jam was "Unknown" and we solved it by making a game where a player does not know who is his friend or foe.
The following rules describe the game:
* There are four players, paired in two teams
* The game takes place on shrinking circular arena (battle-royale style)\
* There are obstacles and random events (falling dynamites)
* The players have two bullets
  + One real - that damages only enemies, and does nothing to allies
  + One fake - with the same mechanics as real, but does not deal damage at all
* The aim of the game is to eliminate the enemy team, while staying alive and out of the wall of death

#### We designed this game with parties in mind - so that it is quick and rewards players with lots of shouting at each another ;)
    Due to the lack of time we didn't manage to make a tournament ladder or multiple rounds
